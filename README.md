# lgpl-java-template

As the repository name suggests, this is a template program in Java licensed
under the LGPL. The Java code is deliberately simple, consisting of just a Hello
World exercise, but the copyright and licensing information in the header
comment is something I'll end up reusing a lot, and the nested folder structure
is correct for programs created under my domain
(kindnesstheorist.dreamwidth.org). The idea is that my future projects can start
with, instead of a bunch of copying and pasting and crossing my fingers to get
configuration details right, forking a program that I already know has done
everything I would do for setup.

Usage: Fork repository. Give descriptive name to fork, or "test"+i if you don't
feel like it. Rename Java package to something equally unique, possibly the same
thing. Compile and run code. Push changes to the forked repository.
Congratulations on your new open source project!

Likely next steps: Rename primary Java class. Replace print statement in main
function with a different statement or set of statements. Add more functions
and/or classes. Update Javadoc documentation to describe added functionality.

Additional important steps for any potential forker who is not Github user
kindnesstheorist: When you're renaming the package, make sure to use a domain
you control. Also, check the copyright and licensing information to make sure
it's correct for the program you're releasing.
